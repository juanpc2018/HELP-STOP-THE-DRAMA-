# HELP-STOP-THE-DRAMA!!!

IF you are tired of Tech Drama,
Programmed Obsolesense Drama, 
Repair Drama, 
Hardware Drama, 
Software Drama, 
Compatibility Drama, 
Updates Drama, 
Support Drama,
Apple drama, 
Intel drama, 
Windows drama, 
BIOS drama, 
NVIDIA drama, 
AMD drama, 
etc...

You want to escape all that...
Just have fun with a machine, 
and as little drama as possible. LOL


Here is a list of what I call Drama:

Acer intel laptops with Inside H2O Bios UEFI has a secret menu to stop people installing Linux.

Apple has a T2 chip to stop people installing Linux, and other things.
Apple MacMini 2014 has soldered RAM,
Apple MacMini 2018 has removable RAM, but Soldered SSD.
Apple M1 has soldered RAM and SSD.
Apple M1 Studio & Max has removable NVMe, but are Not user changeable and are Not compatible with other brands because NVMe controller is on the Board.

Intel Optane 32GB NVMe needs 7th gen CPU, Board and Bios with Optane support,
Because its a RAID Cache technology, needs a RAID Controller,

But Optane NVMe does Not have drivers for Windows8.1
requires HDD/ SSD formatted as GPT Not MBR, 
does Not have drivers for Linux.
needs Windows1O or W11.
Or Needs to buy an intel Server Memory: Optane PM, 
Optane PM Server Memory has drivers for Linux, 
but needs to buy a Intel Xeon CPUs 52XX / 53XX Bronze, Gold, Silver, Platinum.

Windows8,1 Pro does Not allow to Boot from USB3.0, "Windows-To-Go WTG" needs to purchase Enterprise Edition upgrade.
But Purchasing Enterprise Edition is Not easy.
And only works in "approved" External USB3.0 HDD, Not all work like Linux or OSX.

Windows10 OEM license does Not allow to Downgrade to Windows8,1 OEM, 
Requires to purchase Windows8,1 license.
but New Win8.1 licenses are No longer for sale from Microsoft,
Needs to Buy Window10 Pro license to allow Downgrade to Windows8.1 Pro.

OSX HighSierra 10.13.4 added support for eGPU with Thunderbolt3 Macs, 
Apple sells the only bi-directional TB3 to TB2 adapter.
BUT... Deleted OSX support for TB2 Macs.
 
IF you want eGPU with latest OSX Catalina 100% 64-Bit intel,
you need to buy a Mac with TB3, like MacMini 2018, or similar.

AMD GPUs Removed support for Windows8,1 drivers since RX 500.
But Windows8,1 was Not discontinued when that happened.

Windows10 Pro does Not work with 4-Physical CPU socket boards, Only 2 CPUs,
Needs to buy Windows10 Pro for Workstations or Server but Not the Basic Server.

NVIDIA removed CUDA 64-Bit driver support for GTX Titan 6GB PCIe card since drivers 388.
Tested with CUDA-Z
NVIDIA proprietary driver removed some support for Hardware Acceleration / Decoding in Linux for GT 740.

Nvidia GT 1030 
and 
AMD 5300 XT are the minimum with VP9 HW acceleration Decode.

CPU Video HW decoded requires High CPU, 40% - 60% depends on the resolution of the video.

MacPro5,1 2010 allows to install OSX SnowLeopard but same machine from 2012 does Not.
OSX SnowLeopard was designed for intel, 
The reason to stop New machines installing SL was that has Rosetta v1 PPC G4 emulator.
Rosetta was Deleted in OSX Lion 10.7

Apple purchased Shake! Video composing software,
Compiled for PowerPC, and Abandoned when Apple moved to Intel.

IF I have older Hardware like Imacon SCSI scanner,
Imacon SCSI support was removed in New Software by Hasselblad,
You need older software to Scan,
Older software was designed for PPC,
And runs flawless in OSX SnowLeopard Rosetta Emulator,

Firewire was discontinued in 2012,
SCSI to Firewire adapters like Ratoc FireREX / FSR1X 
Apple sells Firewire to Thunderbolt2 adapter,
But Not drivers for OSX SnowLeopard 10.6.8

Installing OSX SL Server in Parallels or VMWare does Not work in a New faster more efficient machine,
Because there is No SCSI PCIe or FireWire Passthrough.

Solution use older Machine, or buy a New scanner and buy a New machine.

New OSX designed for intel machines, does Not work in old intel machines. 
Suddenly intel x86_64 is Not compatible with intel x86_64

Digidesign Digi001 PCIe card
works ok in 975x boards, WinXP & ASIO driver 6.4
but fails in x58 boards from 2010, just a few years later.

AMD HD6950 works ok in 975x boards, WinXP 32-Bit,
but some settings fail in x58 boards, same windows same drivers.
like 2500x1440

Asus Rampage 3 Extreme board has PCI 32-Bit,
but Bios does Not have MPS Table version v1.3, only has "Advanced" = 1.1 Not compatible with Windows8,1
Lynx AES16 pci card does Not install in Windows8.1 with MPS 1.1, but works Ok in W7x64
Win8.1 requires proper Bios MPS 1.3 tables.
same board using OSX SnowLeopard 10.6.6, Lynx AES16 pci works well.
Only msi and ASRock boards have proper 1.3 MPS tables for intel, Gigabyte unknown.
Tyan S8232 AMD Opteron 63OO server board, pci Lynx AES16 installs but buffer size does Not work well.

Newer ATX Boards Z270 & Z370 have very weak socket pins made by Foxxconn, 
different brands msi pc mate & ASRock Z370 Pro4, both with PCI but very brittle cpu metal pins designed to fail,
Not like older X58 1366 socket pins, designed to last.

Matrox developer support refuses to give Discontinued MXO2 SDK.

STOP THE DRAMA.!

Life is too short for all that.
Computers in the 80s & 90s was about having fun, 
Not about having endless problems.

Thats a little list of Why I won't support those companies anymore,
I won't buy nothing more from those companies.

In Psychology thats called: Perverse Incentive / Motivation or The Cobra Effect.

Stop giving Incentives.
Stop feeding the monster.
